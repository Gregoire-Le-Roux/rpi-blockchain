# Wedding Project

This is a blockchain dev web project with Ethers / Hardhat and React.
This project goal is to formalize a wedding between two partners through a contract created in a blockchain.

This project is based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poyVa6yd4X8

So we created the project with _npx create-react-app mariage_, then we installed ethers and hardhat with _npm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers_. Next, in mariage/hardhat.config.js, we added in the bottom :

module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.4",
    paths: {
        artifacts: './src/artifacts',
    },
    networks: {
        hardhat: {
            chainId: 1337
        }
    }
};

Then we did _npx hardhat compile_ to generate the solidity files for our dev app based on the contracts and after that we executed _npx hardhat node_ and choose the private key of one account to import it in metamask.
Now, we just needed the private key of the contract so we wrote this command _npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost_ and we took the private key where the contact is deployed and we add it in App.js.

Everything is now all good so we can just launch the project with _npm start_

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
